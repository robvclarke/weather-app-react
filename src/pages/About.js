          <p>
            Clarke Weather Inc. is a family-run weather company based in Dublin,
            Ireland. Founded in 1991 by visionary CEO Robert Clarke, the company started
            as a small local business providing weather updates to farmers and
            fishermen in the community. Over the years, it has grown into a
            trusted source of weather information for the entire region and indeed the world.

            Our journey began with a single weather station in our backyard.

            community helped us expand.
